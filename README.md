 The project is an attempt at recreating a lot of the main components of the Amazon website, with the end goal including: accepting payment (with stripe), creating unique order IDs, accepting multiple inputs (address, name, etc), functionable buttons, functional checkout cart and lastly a complete registration / sign in / sign out system.
